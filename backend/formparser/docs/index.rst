:code:`streaming_form_data` provides a Python parser for parsing
:code:`multipart/form-data` input chunks (the most commonly used encoding when
submitting values through HTML forms). Chunk size is determined by the API user,
but currently there are no restrictions on what the size should be, since the
parser works byte-by-byte. This also means that passing the entire input as a
single chunk should also work.

Please note, that this library has only been tested with Python 3 (specifically,
versions 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6). Python 2.7 is not supported yet, but pull
requests are always welcome. ðŸ™‚

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install streaming_form_data

The core parser is written in :code:`Cython`, which is a superset of Python but
compiles the input down to a C extension which can then be imported in normal
Python code.

The compiled C parser code is included in the PyPI package, hence the
installation requires a working C compiler.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from streaming_form_data import StreamingFormDataParser
    >>> from streaming_form_data.targets import ValueTarget, FileTarget, NullTarget
    >>>
    >>> headers = {'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=boundary'}
    >>>
    >>> parser = StreamingFormDataParser(headers=headers)
    >>>
    >>> parser.register('name', ValueTarget())
    >>> parser.register('file', FileTarget('/tmp/file.txt'))
    >>> parser.register('discard-me', NullTarget())
    >>>
    >>> parser.data_received(chunk)

The parser is fed chunks of (bytes) input, and takes action depending on what
the current byte is. In case it notices input that's expected (input that has
been registered by calling :code:`parser.register`, it will pass on the input to
the registered :code:`Target` class which will then decide what to do with it.
In case there's a part which is not needed, it can be associated to a
:code:`NullTarget` object and it will be discarded.


API
---

The API has two main points of entry:

- :code:`StreamingFormDataParser` class - This is the main entry point, and
  expects a dictionary of request :code:`headers`. These headers are used to
  determine the input :code:`Content-Type`.
- :code:`Target` class(es) - When registering inputs with the parser, instances
  of subclasses of the :code:`Target` class should be used, since these targets
  ultimately determine what to do with the data.

Currently the following three :code:`Target` classes are included with this
library.

- :code:`ValueTarget` - holds the input in memory
- :code:`FileTarget` - pipes the input to a file on disk
- :code:`SHA256Target` - computes the SHA-256 hash of the input

Any new targets should inherit :code:`streaming_form_data.targets.BaseTarget`
and define a :code:`data_received` function.


Examples
--------

Most of the testing has been done using the :code:`Tornado` web framework which
allows reading HTTP request data as it arrives in chunks. If you'd like to
document usage with another web framework (which ideally allows chunked reads),
please open an issue or a pull request. ðŸ™‚
